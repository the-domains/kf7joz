My name is Andrew and my amature callsign is KF7JOZ. Currently, I hold a General class license and one day, when I have more free time, will study and receive a Extra class license. I currently own 3 stations, two handheld VHF/UHF and one mobile VHF/UHF. 

Recently I have been work with hsmm-mesh technology. I started working with this technology helping the broadband-hamnet test its first release on the ubiquiti hardware. 

Once I finished helping test the technology I installed a radio on my roof, a [ubiquiti nanobridge 2M][0], and pointed it at Salt Lake Community College in Salt Lake City and joined a small mesh network.

Other hams in the area have been creating a large mesh network in Salt Lake County with a number of hub sites using 5 ghz [ubiquiti rockets][1]. I am going to help this effort by creating a raspberry pi image that basically runs a [team talk v5][2] server and probably a speed test site. These pi's will be installed at strategic hub sites and allow hams to communicate together throughout the wasatch front. This software allows for video chat, voice chat, text chat, file sharing, and desktop sharing. The wide range of selections is important since not all mesh users will have the signal strength to support video chat.
